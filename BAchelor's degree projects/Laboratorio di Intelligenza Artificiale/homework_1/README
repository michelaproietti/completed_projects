 This homework consists in the creation of a C++ class wrapping an Orazio client.
 Orazio is a firmware for mobile robots that can be used with different architectures.
 
 To run this code, Orazio software must be installed and then the following commands should be executed:
 
	1) Move this folder in srrg2_orazio/srrg2_orazio

	2) Run make in srrg2_orazio/srrg2_orazio/host_build

	3) Compile using make in this folder and check the solution with orazio_wrapper_test
