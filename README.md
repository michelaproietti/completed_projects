## Bachelor's degree projects
This folder contains the projects realized during the Bachelor's degree in Computer and Automation Engineering at Sapienza University of Rome. The following list contains the names of the courses and a brief description of the projects:

* **Laboratorio di Intelligenza Artificiale (AI Laboratory)**: set of 5 homeworks aimed at solving different tasks, namely using Orazio firmware for robotic mobile bases, executing different tasks using Turtlesim, and implementing an image classification algorithm. These homeworks were developed using different frameworks and languages, such as ROS (Robot Operating System), C++, Tensorflow and Python.
* **Metodi Quantitativi per l'Informativa (Quantitative Methods for Computer Science)**: the project consisted in developing a few-shot-learning algorithm for image classification that was used in Duckietown initiative. Two methods have been developed, one simply using cross-entropy loss and a second one using triplet loss and metric learning. The dataset has been manually built from the Duckietown simulator in order to be able to train and test the two methods. This project was further extended to be used as my bachelor's thesis.
* **Bachelor's thesis**: the previous project was extended in order to make the algorithms faster so to be suitable for real-time application in Duckietown. Moreover, a datasets of real images was created by adapting an existing dataset and it was used to fine tune the models and make them usable in real world. Finally, the algorithms were adapted to be used with images containing multiple objects, by applying them to smaller patches. Comparisons between the classification time and the performance of the two developed methods applied respectively to the simulated and to the real dataset are present.

## Master's degree projects
This folder contains the projects realized during the Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome. The following list contains the names of the courses and a brief description of the projects:

* **Fundamentals of Computer Graphics**: three homeworks in which I implemented very simple raytracer, path tracer and volumetric path tracer using the library YoctoGL. Everything has been done using Visual Studio Code with C/C++.
* **Interactive Graphics**: two homeworks consisting in the implementation of basic tasks in computer graphics, such as rendering a scene, shadowing, variable lighting and animations with WebGL, and a final project realized in group with other colleagues, which consists in the implementation of a web version of the mobile game "Crossy road", using WebGL and the advanced library ThreeJS. It is possible to play the game at [this link](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-mpps-team/main.html).
* **Machine Learning**: two homeworks in which we needed to solve two different classification tasks using respectively traditional ML approaches and neural networks and a Reinforcement Learning project in which [TRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477v5) has been implemented using python3 and tensorflow 2 and tested on Mujocoâ€™s [HalfCheetah-v2] (https://gym.openai.com/envs/HalfCheetah-v2/) environment.
