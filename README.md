## Bachelor's degree projects
This folder contains the projects realized during the Bachelor's degree in Computer and Automation Engineering at Sapienza University of Rome. The following list contains the names of the courses and a brief description of the projects:

* **Laboratorio di Intelligenza Artificiale (AI Laboratory)**: set of 5 homeworks aimed at solving different tasks, namely using Orazio firmware for robotic mobile bases, executing different tasks using Turtlesim, and implementing an image classification algorithm. These homeworks were developed using different frameworks and languages, such as ROS (Robot Operating System), C++, Tensorflow and Python.
* **Metodi Quantitativi per l'Informativa (Quantitative Methods for Computer Science)**: the project consisted in developing a few-shot-learning algorithm for image classification that was used in Duckietown initiative. Two methods have been developed, one simply using cross-entropy loss and a second one using triplet loss and metric learning. The dataset has been manually built from the Duckietown simulator in order to be able to train and test the two methods. This project was further extended to be used as my bachelor's thesis.
* **Bachelor's thesis**: the previous project was extended in order to make the algorithms faster so to be suitable for real-time application in Duckietown. Moreover, a datasets of real images was created by adapting an existing dataset and it was used to fine tune the models and make them usable in real world. Finally, the algorithms were adapted to be used with images containing multiple objects, by applying them to smaller patches. Comparisons between the classification time and the performance of the two developed methods applied respectively to the simulated and to the real dataset are present.
