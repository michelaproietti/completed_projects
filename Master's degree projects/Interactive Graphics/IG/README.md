# Interactive Graphics Final Project

This is the repository of the final project of the Interactive Graphics course.

The proposed project is a re-implementation of the famous "Crossy Road" game. It features different difficulty levels, several environments, various user customizations in the main menu and different animations. Some aspects are based on the original game, while other features are the brainchild of programmers. The project was implemented using the advanced library "ThreeJS". The animations were implemented manually in WebGL via javascript.

***Advice:*** We advise using Chrome or Edge (Chromium version) for a better experience
